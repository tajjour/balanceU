**Team Members:**

- Damian Kilday, Product owner
- Wesley Rolnick, Scrummaster
- Tarek Ajjour, Team Member
- Nathaniel Hedmann, Team Member
- Alec Moeser, Team Member
- Walter Thornton, Team Member

**Canvas Group Name:**  Project Team 3

**Slack Channel Name:** scrumdiddlyumptious

**Git Repository:** https://github.com/tajjour/balanceU

**Product Name:** BalanceU

**Far Vision:** Helping students balance their lives

**Near Vision:** Providing an application for students to share workload data about classes.

**Stakeholder Types:**

- Existing student (Real person)
- Prospective student
- Professor
- Application Admninistrator

**User Persona for Tarek Ajjour (Real Person):** https://app.xtensio.com/folio/9rrqkvy4

**Initial Backlog URL (with estimated PBIs):**  https://trello.com/b/JRxxjxt1/product-backlog 
**Backlog Note 1:** Backlog items are written as user stories, but you must click on each item to see the story.
**Backlog Note 2:** The numbers preceding the item titles are story points.

**Rationale for Backlog Ordering:**  We relied on one rule and three principles/considerations. The rule was based on logical dependence: no item could be ahead of any item that it depended on to work.  The first principle was "low effort/high value": things that could be done reasonably quickly given their payoff were prioritized.  The second principle was similarity: if one backlog item was closely related to another, they were kept sequential. The third consideration was related to testing: things were ordered so that we would have available easy testing capabilities for new items, without additional work.

**Definition of Ready:**  

A product backlog item is ready when:

- it has a meaningful title;
- it is expressed as a user story;
- it is defined clearly;
- it is not subject to further clear subdivision;
- it is estimated in story points; and
- it is not dependent on any other backlog item being completed first.

(In addition to course activities, this definition of ready also was influenced by articles by Scrum Inc., at https://www.scruminc.com/2014/07/20/definition-of-ready/; and Mike Cohn, Mountain Goat Software, at https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-dangers-of-a-definition-of-ready.)

**Whole Team Relative Size Estimating Activity:** The Bucket System (see http://www.agileadvice.com/2013/07/30/referenceinformation/agile-estimation-with-the-bucket-system/).
Only development team members participated in estimating backlog item sizes.


##Part 2

**Forecast**: 12 story points

**Forecast Rationale:** Assuming a five-member dev team, and given the size of our base story point, we believed that between 2 and 3 story points per member per sprint was an appropriate size for someone working the equivalent of a 4-credit class.

**Current Sprint Kanban Board:** https://trello.com/b/R462ru7U/current-sprint  **Note 1**: Only dev team members participated in pulling backlog items into sprint backlog.  **Note 2:** No backlog item represented more than half the size of the spring forecast.

**Task Decomposition**: See inside each sprint backlog item, under chacklist labeled "Tasks."

**Daily Scrums:** 11/8; 11/10; 11/11; 11/12; 11/13.

*Documentation of 11/12 Daily Scrum:


Damian:  We need a quick update from you on what you've done in the past 24 hours and what you intend to do in the next 24 hours.  Also any luck writing a BDD test in Cucumber?  **Update from Slack**: Damian did get Cucumber working and added a BDD test to the project.  **Impediment**: problems getting floobits working.

Alec: Wrote unit tests.  Plans on managing the github requests from all of our updates.  **Impediment**: problems getting code to compile

Than: Rebuilt the project so that it now loads.  Plans to pickup an item off the product backlog.  **Impediment**: Issues with Floobits.

Tarek: Worked on the project to create more classes.  Setup Cucumber to handle BDD.  Will help Than with implementing fixed code.  Continuing to support WebEx and Teleconferences. **Impediment**: Issues with floobits.

Wes: Acted as Scrum Master.  Tracked progress to rubric.  Will be working on the floobits impediment that the team has had.

**Sprint Review:** 11/14:

[Link to working build.](http://54.183.213.247:8080/)

The first Sprint Review was held after class on 11/14.  Two Stakeholders attended and provided feedback on the current build.  Their suggestions were primarily centered around improving the UI and adding more functionality.  We also went through the Sprint items with our Product Owner (Damian) and agreed on what was done and what will continue in our backlog.
